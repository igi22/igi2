USING THE CONSOLE
-----------------

The executable 'console.exe' found in the main game directory is used to remotely control a running
IGI2 game server, dedicated or non-dedicated. It can be run from any computer.

- Open a 'DOS-window' and change directory to the main game directory where console.exe is located.

- Enter console <ip> <port>, where ip and port specifies the server you want to access. For example
  console 127.0.0.1 26002 would try to access a game server running at ip 127.0.0.1 and port 26002.

- You should now see the IGI2> prompt, and the application will ask you to enter a password.
  This password is the *rcon password*. Just enter the password alone and press enter.

- To test if you really have access now, try a simple and harmless command, like : 'lo timeout'.
  You should get the current timeout value from the server in return.

- When you access the server from the console, you are considered to actually enter your commands
  directly on the server.
  
  In the command section below you will see commands described as only working if entered
  from the server, i.e. not from a client. All those commands will also work from the console.

- The server will remove you from its console user list if you idle for too long. If this happens, 
  the console will ask you to re-enter the password before you can enter other commands.

- Type 'exit' to end the console session, or press CTRL-C.  

- The server may lose some of your commands. Re-issue a command if you are not correctly prompted.

- Here are a few examples of commands. You will all commands in the COMMANDS section further below:
	
	sv listmaps					- Lists all available maps. Note the number before the name, the mapID.
	sv gotomap <mapID>			- Changes map to <mapID>
	sv restartmap				- Restarts currently played map.
	lo activatemap <mapID>		- Adds the map to the play list.
	lo deactivatemap <mapID>	- Removes the map from the play list.
	sv gotonext					- Changes map to the next map in the play list.
	lo announce("HELLO");		- Says HELLO (or anything you want) to all players on the server.
	lo serverpass				- Displays the password needed to join the server.
	lo serverpass("BANANA");	- Sets the password to BANANA.
	lo serverpass("");			- Removes any password rendering the server free for all to join.
	sv finger					- Lists all players on the server. Note the first number, the playerID.
	
	sv kick <playerID>			- Kicks player with given playerID out of the server.
	
	sv ban <playerID>			- Adds the IP of player to the ban list. 
	sv listban					- Lists all addresses currently banned.
	sv unban <listnumber>		- Removes ban from given address. First run 'sv listban' to get the list number.


COMMANDS

How to enter them and how to understand the list
------------------------------------------------

- Asterix (*) indicates that remote control privilleges are needed to run the following command.

- Do not enter the asterix nor any brackets([]).

- Make sure you enter semi-colons(;) and quotes(") where indicated. Also make sure: *no space*
  between command and any following paranthesis.

- Examples of valid commands as entered in the console:

	sv rcon("somepass");
	sv kick 3
	sv unban 1
	sv suicide
	lo moneystart 3400


Remote control
--------------

[ ]sv rcon("<passwd>");								// Get access to remote control

[ ]sv votekick <playerID>							// vote for playerID to be kicked from the server.

[*]sv ban <playerID>								// ban playerID from server.

[ ]sv listban										// list IPs banned.

[*]sv unban <list number>							// remove IP from the list of bans, using the wanted IPs position in
													// that list as parameter. Run listban to see the IPs list position.

[ ]sv suicide										// Die and respawn.


Map Control
-----------

[*]sv restartmap									// Restarts and initiates the map currently being played.

[ ]sv listmaps										// list maps to console showing mapID and map name. All maps in the
													// active map cycle are marked [ACTIVE].

[ ]lo activatemap <mapID>							// Places the given map into the active map cycle. Must be executed on server.

[ ]lo deactivatemap <mapID>							// Removes the given map from the active map cycle if found. Must be executed on server.

[*]sv gotonext										// load next map in the active map cycle.

[ ]sv votemap <mapID>								// vote for a map change to the mapID map.

[ ]sv votenext										// vote to change map to the next map in the active map cycle.

[ ]sv showvotes										// show votes for both kick player and maps.

Shop
----
[*]sv addmoney <amount>							// add amount money to all players. Use negative values to deduct money.

[*]sv accounts										// list accounts of all players


System
------

[*]sv monitor										// Call to periodically receive network status information
													// from server. Call again to disable.

[*]sv/lo ploss <amount>								// add packetloss in parts per thousand. 0 is no loss, 1000 is everything.

[ ]sv/lo timeout <seconds>							// time before a non-responding client is kicked from the server,
													// and before a client leaves a game with a dead server.
													// If set too low, hosts will start to disconnect good games for wrong
													// reasons. 20 seconds seems reasonable.

[ ]sv/lo updatestats								// show percentages of pos updates sent for the various reasons.

[ ]lo bandwidth <number>							// Parameter adjusting the bandwidth usage to and from the local player.
													// 0: Infinite bandwidth capacity is assumed.
													// 1-1000: From very low bandwidth capacity(1) to very high capacity (1000).

[ ]lo choke <kBps>									// On Server: The maximum number of kilobytes per second your server will output.
													// If the demand for data is bigger than this choke value, the server will
													// skip sending high pri positional data. See fillpercent.

[ ]lo fillpercent <percent>							// On Server: This value is just a safety margin for the choke settings. Actual choke
													// value used in the system is the choke value set above and then multiplied by fillpercent.
													// E.g: choke of 14 and fillpercent of 60 means actual system choke of 14*0.60 = 8.4 (kB/s)
													// Simply set fillpercent value to 100 to disable its influence.

[ ]lo smooth <percentage>							// Adjusts smoothing of remote players on your screen.
													// 100: Best smoothing, worst accuracy of real player location.
													// 1: Worst smoothing, best accuracy of real player location.
